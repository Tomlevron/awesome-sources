# Awesome-Sources #

Lists of libraries, blogs, book and more that are found useful.
This list is inspired by [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome).
To build this list i used [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/tchapi/markdown-cheatsheet/blob/master/README.md), [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) and the offical github [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

Basic and common sources or libraries such as [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) are not listed.
